Option 1

Keep ABC-FORM & ABC-APP unchanged, migrate all MND-MS/DD APIs to XXX-MS

| Pros (Advantages)                       | Cons (Disadvantages)                              |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Minimal changes to ABC-FORM and ABC-APP | Legacy architecture remains                       |
| Lowest implementation effort            | No improvement to gateway capability              |
| Fastest time to market                  | API standards remain inconsistent                 |
| Lower migration and regression risk     | Technical debt continues to accumulate            |
| No frontend refactoring required        | Limited scalability and extensibility             |
| Existing integration logic preserved    | Harder to enforce unified security and governance |
| Suitable for short-term delivery        | Not aligned with long-term platform strategy      |


Option 2

Migrate ABC-APP to XXX-GW, migrate MND-MS to XXX-MS, ABC-FORM requires changes

| Pros (Advantages)                              | Cons (Disadvantages)                        |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Unified API gateway (XXX-GW)                   | Higher implementation complexity            |
| Standardized API interface and governance      | Requires changes in ABC-FORM                |
| Better long-term maintainability               | Longer delivery timeline                    |
| Improved security, authentication, and routing | Higher initial cost                         |
| Easier service expansion and integration       | Higher migration and regression risk        |
| Clear separation of concerns                   | Requires coordination across multiple teams |
| Strong alignment with platform strategy        | More extensive testing required             |

summary
| Aspect                 | Option 1 | Option 2 |
| ---------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Short-term efficiency  | ✅ High   | ❌ Low    |
| Long-term architecture | ❌ Weak   | ✅ Strong |
| Risk level             | ✅ Low    | ❌ Higher |
| Strategic alignment    | ❌ Low    | ✅ High   |
