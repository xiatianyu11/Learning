Following the review of the current system architecture, we have analyzed two possible modification approaches for integrating **ABC-FORM**, **ABC-APP**, and **MND-MS/DD** with the target **XXX platform**.
Below is a summary of both options, including their key advantages and disadvantages, for your reference and decision-making.

---

### Option 1

**Keep ABC-FORM and ABC-APP unchanged; migrate all MND-MS/DD APIs to XXX-MS**

**Pros:**

* Minimal impact on existing systems (ABC-FORM & ABC-APP remain unchanged)
* Lowest implementation effort and development cost
* Faster delivery and shorter time to market
* Lower migration and regression risk
* Suitable for short-term business requirements

**Cons:**

* Legacy architecture remains unchanged
* No unified gateway or API standardization
* Limited improvement in scalability and extensibility
* Technical debt continues to accumulate
* Weak alignment with long-term platform and architecture strategy

---

### Option 2

**Migrate ABC-APP to XXX-GW, migrate MND-MS to XXX-MS; ABC-FORM requires changes**

**Pros:**

* Unified gateway (XXX-GW) with standardized API interfaces
* Better long-term maintainability and architectural clarity
* Improved security, governance, and traffic control
* Easier future expansion and integration with new systems
* Strong alignment with long-term platform strategy

**Cons:**

* Higher implementation complexity and initial cost
* Requires changes to ABC-FORM
* Longer delivery timeline
* Higher migration and testing effort
* Increased coordination required across multiple teams

---

### Summary

* **Option 1** is more suitable if the priority is **quick delivery, low risk, and minimal change**.
* **Option 2** is recommended if the priority is **long-term platform standardization, scalability, and architectural governance**.

Please let us know your preferred direction or if further analysis (e.g. phased approach, cost estimation, or timeline comparison) is required.
